//                  Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
//    We can also multiply one number by another.
//    JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.
//    Example
//const myVar = 13 * 13;
//myVar would have the value 169.
//Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.

//                 Tests
//Passed:The variable product should be equal to 80.
//Passed:You should use the * operator.


//Solution
//const product = 8 * 0;

var num1 = 8;
var num2 = 10;
var product = num1 * num2;
